PHP Tests
================

You have to make a 
`function countones($number)`

The parameter is decimal number and the returned result should be  the sum of the ones in the representation<br>
of the same number in Binary system.

For example:
```
countones(7) should return 3 as result
countones(8) should return 1 as result
```
